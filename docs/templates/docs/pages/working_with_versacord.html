                    Creating a Bot Account
                </h2>
                <p>To work with the library and the Discord API in general, we must first create a Discord Bot account.
                </p>
                <p>Creating a Bot account is a pretty straightforward process.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Make sure you’re logged on to the <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord
                            website</a>.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications"
                            target="_blank">Applications page</a>.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click on the “New Application” button.</p><img

                    <li>
                        <p>Give the application a name and click “Create”.</p><img

                    <li>
                        <p>Create a Bot User account by navigating to the “Bot” tab and clicking “Add Bot”.</p>
                        <p>Click “Yes, do it!” to continue.</p>

                        <p>You should also make sure that <b>Require OAuth2 Code Grant</b> is unchecked unless you are
                            developing a service that needs it. If you’re unsure, then <b>leave it unchecked</b>.</p>

                            <p>The possibilities are endless, so do not share this token.</p>
