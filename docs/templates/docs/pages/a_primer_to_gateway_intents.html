                <p>In version 1.5 comes the introduction of <span class="code-style">Intents</span>. This is a radical
                    change in how bots are written.
                    Put simply, an intent allows a bot to subscribe to specific buckets of events. The events that
                    correspond to each intent are documented in the individual attribute of the <span
                        class="code-style">Intents</span> documentation.
                </p>

                <p>These intents are passed to the constructor of <span class="code-style">Client</span> or its
                    subclasses (<span class="code-style">AutoShardedClient</span>,
                    <span class="code-style">AutoShardedBot</span>, <span class="code-style">Bot</span>) with the
                    intents argument.
                </p>

                <p>If intents are not passed, then the library defaults to every intent being enabled except the
                    privileged intents, currently <span class="code-style">Intents.members</span>, <span
                        class="code-style">Intents.presences</span>, and <span
                        class="code-style">Intents.message_content</span>.</p>
                <div class="mt-5"></div>
                <h2 class="doc-h2" id="Whatintentsareneeded?">
                    What intents are needed?
                </h2>
                <p>The intents that are necessary for your bot can only be dictated by yourself. Each attribute in the
                    <span class="code-style">Intents</span> class documents what <span class="code-style">events</span>
                    it corresponds to and what kind of cache it enables.
                </p>
                <p>For example, if you want a bot that functions without spammy events like presences or typing then we
                    could do the following:</p>

                <code>
                import versacord<br>
                intents = versacord.Intents.default()<br>
                intents.typing = False<br>
                intents.presences = False<br><br>
               
                # Somewhere else:<br>
                # client = versacord.Client(intents=intents)<br>
                # or<br>
                # from versacord.ext import commands<br>
                # bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)<br>
               </code>

                <p>Note that this doesn’t enable <span class="code-style">Intents.members</span> since it’s a privileged
                    intent.</p>
                <p>Another example showing a bot that only deals with messages and guild information:</p>

                <code>
                    import versacord<br>
                    intents = versacord.Intents(messages=True, guilds=True)<br>
                    # If you also want reaction events enable the following:<br>
                    # intents.reactions = True<br><br>
                    
                    # Somewhere else:<br>
                    # client = versacord.Client(intents=intents)<br>
                    # or<br>
                    # from versacord.ext import commands<br>
                    # bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)<br>

                <p>With the API change requiring bot authors to specify intents, some intents were restricted further
                    and require more manual steps. These intents are called <b>privileged intents</b>.</p>

                <p>A privileged intent is an intent that requires you to go to the developer portal and manually enable

                    Member Cache
                </h2>
                <p>Along with intents, Discord now further restricts the ability to cache members and expects bot
                    authors to cache as little as is necessary. However, to properly maintain a cache the
                    <span class="code-style">Intents.members</span> intent is required to track the members who left and
                    properly evict them.
                </p>

                <p>To aid with member cache where we don’t need members to be cached, the library now has a
                    <span class="code-style">MemberCacheFlags</span> flag to control the member cache. The documentation
                    page for the class goes over
                    the specific policies that are possible.
                </p>

                <p>It should be noted that certain things do not need a member cache since Discord will provide full
                    member information if possible. For example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>

                        <p><span class="code-style">on_reaction_add()</span> will have the <span

                            disabled.</p>

                <p>Some common issues relating to the mandatory intent change.</p>

                <h4 class="doc-h4">Where did my members go?</h4>
                <p>Due to an <span class="code-style">API change</span> Discord is now forcing developers who want
                    member caching to explicitly opt in
                    to it. This is a Discord mandated change and there is no way to bypass it. To get members back, you
                    have to explicitly enable the <span class="code-style">members privileged intent</span> and change
                    the <span class="code-style">Intents.members</span> attribute to
                    true.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <code>
                    import versacord<br>
                    intents = versacord.Intents.default()<br>
                    intents.members = True<br><br>
                   
                    # Somewhere else:<br>
                    # client = versacord.Client(intents=intents)<br>
                    # or<br>
                    # from versacord.ext import commands<br>
                    # bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)<br>
                   
                </code>
                <div class="mt-5"></div>
                <h4 class="doc-h4">What happened to my prefix commands?</h4>
                <p>Due to an <span class="code-style">API change</span>, to read message content in most messages, you
                    have to explicitly opt in to it.
                    This is a Discord mandated change and there is no way to bypass it. To get message content back, you
                    have to explicitly enable the <span class="code-style">message content privileged intent</span> and
                    change the
                    <span class="code-style">Intents.message_content</span> attribute to true.
                </p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <code>
                    import versacord<br>
                    intents = versacord.Intents.default()<br>
                    intents.message_content = True<br><br>
                   
                    # Somewhere else:<br>
                    # client = versacord.Client(intents=intents)<br>
                    # or<br>
                    # from versacord.ext import commands<br>
                    # bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)<br>
                </code>
                <div class="mt-5"></div>
                <h4 class="doc-h4">Why does <span class="code-style">on_ready</span> take so long to fire?</h4>
                <p>As part of the API change regarding intents, Discord also changed how members are loaded in the
                    beginning. Originally the library could request 75 guilds at once and only request members from
                    guilds that have the <span class="code-style">Guild.large</span> attribute set to <span
                        class="code-style">True</span>. With the new intent changes, Discord
                    mandates that we can only send 1 guild per request. This causes a 75x slowdown which is further
                    compounded by the fact that all guilds, not just large guilds are being requested.</p>

                <p>There are a few solutions to fix this.</p>

                <p>The first solution is to request the privileged presences intent along with the privileged members
                    intent and enable both of them. This allows the initial member list to contain online members just
                    like the old gateway. Note that we’re still limited to 1 guild per request but the number of guilds
                    we request is significantly reduced.</p>

                <p>The second solution is to disable member chunking by setting <span
                        class="code-style">chunk_guilds_at_startup</span> to <span class="code-style">False</span> when
                    constructing a client. Then, when chunking for a guild is necessary you can use the various
                    techniques to <span class="code-style">retrieve members</span>.</p>

                <p>To illustrate the slowdown caused by the API change, take a bot that is in 840 guilds and 95 of these
                    guilds are “large” (over 250 members).</p>

                <p>Under the original system, this would result in 2 requests to fetch the member list (75 guilds, 20
                    guilds) roughly taking 60 seconds. With <span class="code-style">Intents.members</span> but not
                    <span class="code-style">Intents.presences</span> this requires 840
                    requests, with a rate limit of 120 requests per 60 seconds means that due to waiting for the rate
                    limit it totals to around 7 minutes of waiting for the rate limit to fetch all the members. With
                    both <span class="code-style">Intents.members</span> and <span
                        class="code-style">Intents.presences</span> we mostly get the old behaviour so we’re only
                    required to
                    request for the 95 large guilds, this is slightly less than our rate limit so it’s close to the
                    original timing to fetch the member list.
                </p>

                <p>Unfortunately due to this change being required from Discord there is nothing that the library can do
                    to mitigate this.</p>
