                </h2>
                <p>Let’s make a bot that responds to a slash command and walk you through it.</p>
                <p>It looks something like this:</p>

                <code>import versacord<br>
                from versacord.ext import commands<br><br>

                TESTING_GUILD_ID = 123456789  # Replace with your guild ID<br><br>

                bot = commands.Bot()<br><br>

                @bot.event<br>
                async def on_ready():<br>
                    print(f'We have logged in as {bot.user}')<br><br>

                @bot.slash_command(description="My first slash command", guild_ids=[TESTING_GUILD_ID])<br>
                async def hello(interaction: versacord.Interaction):<br>
                    await interaction.send("Hello!")<br><br>

                bot.run('your token here')</code>

                <p>Let’s name this file <span class="code-style">example_bot.py</span>. Make sure not to name it
                    <span class="code-style">versacord</span> as
                    that’ll conflict with the library.
                </p>

                <p>A lot is going on here, so let’s walk you through it step by step.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first line just imports the library, if this raises a
                        <span class="code-style"><a
                                href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError"
                                target="_blank">ModuleNotFoundError</a></span>
                        or
                        <span class="code-style"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError"
                                target="_blank">ImportError</a></span>
                        then head on over to <a href="/docs#installation">Installing</a> section to properly install.
                    </li>
                    <li>The second line imports the Bot commands framework which allows us to use the Bot class to
                        create our bot.</li>
                    <li>After that, we will declare a constant called <span class="code-style">TESTING_GUILD_ID</span>
                        which will be used
                        to identify the guild we want to use. This will allow us to test the command immediately in our
                        server. Without this, we would have to wait up to an hour for the global command to register.
                    </li>
                    <li>Next, we create an instance of a Bot. This bot is our connection to Discord.</li>
                    <li>We then use the bot.event decorator to register an event. This library has many events. Since
                        this library is asynchronous, we do things in a “callback” style manner.<br>A callback is
                        essentially a function that is called when something happens. In our case, the on_ready() event
                        is called when the bot has finished logging in and setting things up.</li>
                    <li>Next, we use the bot.slash_command decorator to register a slash command. This decorator can
                        take arguments for configuring the slash commands such as the description and guild IDs where
                        you want the command to be registered. The callback of the slash command takes in an Interaction
                        object as a parameter which can be used to respond to the user. In the callback, we use the
                        method Interaction.send() to reply.</li>
                    <li>Finally, we run the bot with our login token. If you need help getting your token or creating a
                        bot, look in the Creating a Bot Account section.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Now that we’ve made a bot, we have to run the bot. Luckily, this is simple since this is just a
                    Python script, we can run it directly.</p>
                <p>On Windows:</p>

                <code>$ py -3 example_bot.py</code>
                <p>On other systems:</p>
                <code>$ python3 example_bot.py</code>

                <p>Now you can try playing around with your basic bot</p>
                <p>You can find more examples in the <a
                        href="https://github.com/owera/versa-framework/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">examples
                        directory</a> on GitHub.

                    Setting Up Logging
                </h2>
                <p>versacord logs errors and debug information via the logging python module. It is strongly recommended
                    that the logging module is configured, as no errors or warnings will be output if it is not set up.
                    Configuration of the <span class="code-style">logging</span> module can be as simple as:</p>

                <code>
                    import logging<br><br>

                    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
                </code>

                <p>Placed at the start of the application. This will output the logs from discord as well as other
                    libraries that use the <span class="code-style">logging</span> module directly to the console.</p>

                <p>The optional level argument specifies what <span class="code-style">level</span> of events to log out
                    and can be any of <span class="code-style">CRITICAL</span>, <span class="code-style">ERROR</span>,
                    <span class="code-style">WARNING</span>, <span class="code-style">INFO</span>, and <span
                        class="code-style">DEBUG</span> and if not specified defaults to <span
                        class="code-style">WARNING</span>.
                </p>

                <p>More advanced setups are possible with the logging module. For example to write the logs to a file
                    called <span class="code-style">versacord.log</span> instead of outputting them to the console the
                    following snippet can be used:</p>

                <code>
                    import versacord<br>
                    import logging<br><br>

                    logger = logging.getLogger('versacord')<br>
                    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)<br>
                    handler = logging.FileHandler(filename='versacord.log', encoding='utf-8', mode='w')<br>
                    handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s:%(levelname)s:%(name)s: %(message)s'))<br>
                    logger.addHandler(handler)

                </code>

                This is recommended, especially at verbose levels such as <span class="code-style">INFO</span> and <span
                    class="code-style">DEBUG</span>, as there are a lot of events logged and it would clog the stdout of
                your program.
